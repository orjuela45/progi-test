# Car auction push algorithm

Hi there, this is an algorithm that can calculate which is the maximum mount to push for one car after aplicated some fees according to one budget.

__Note__: To specificate the budget you have to go to file algorithm.php in the line 10, you can put a number or an array of numbers in the variable $budgetValues. for example
```
$budgetValues = 670.01;
```
OR
```
$budgetValues = [1000.00, 670.00, 670.01, 110.00, 111.00, 116.02, 1000000.00];
```

I hope that this algorithm comply wiht the requerid
